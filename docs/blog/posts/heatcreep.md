# Clearing a Heat Creep Jam

Clear a heat creep jam without disassembling your 3D printer.

<!-- more -->

This method works best with a hotend that is easy to remove nozzles from, like the Sliceengineering Mosquito.

Follow these steps to clear a heat creep jam:

1. Heat up your hotend to printing temperatures for the jammed filament.
1. While waiting for the hotend to heat up, you may want to release your extruder tension.
1. Remove the nozzle from your hotend.
1. Insert a 1.5mm hex key into the hole where the nozzle was.
1. Wait a few seconds for the hex key to heat up.
1. Push up with the hex key to push the clog upwards.
1. Repeat the previous two steps until the clog is cleared.
1. Keeping the hex key in the hotend, reach into the extruder with pliers and pull the filament out.
1. Restore extruder tension.
1. Reinstall your nozzle.
1. If necessary, re-calibrate your Z offset.
